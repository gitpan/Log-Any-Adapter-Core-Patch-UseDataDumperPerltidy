NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Core::Patch::UseDataDumperPerltidy - Use
    Data::Dumper::Perltidy

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Any '$log';
     use Log::Any::PT; # shortcut for Log::Any::Adapter::Core::Patch::UseDataDumperPerltidy;

     $log->debug("See this data structure: %s", $some_data);

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Any dumps data structures using Data::Dumper with settings:
    Indent=0. This is rather hard to read. This patch replaces dumping with
    using Data::Dumper::Perltidy which has nicer output.

    But note that Data::Dumper::Perltidy is rather slow (about 500x slower
    than Data::Dumper and 50x slower than Data::Dump) and has heavier
    startup time (about 0.1s, 37K lines). IMO it has the nicest output
    though.
